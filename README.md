# RealityKit-sample

## Small repository for test of the macos realitykit

### App:

- current  code creates a uiview,
- allows to select a file / folder and
- either shows the usdz file or
- converts a image folder  (if folder is selected) or
- converts a movie into separate images, if a movie file is selected
- opens model files directly

### Good sample image is kermit

Artistic stuff can be very easily made using a timelapse movie (see ![example-bone](/assets/appView-2.png))
The tool currently limits movies to 100 frames (if needed spread over the entire movie by skipping some frames) ![example-bone](/assets/appView.png)
